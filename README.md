Thinkful Data Science Capstone 1: Experimental Design

This is my experimental design research project for Thinkful's Data Science boot camp.

Research Goals:

1. Compare differences in exoplanet mass for exoplanets whose host star has a stellar mass greater than or equal to our sun against those orbiting a host star with a mass less than our sun.
2. Investigate differences in orbital periods and in distance from our solar system.
3. Provide framework for analysis of exoplanets in determining their viability and desirability as a target for human colonization.

The .slides file is an html document - a slide deck created with the RISE extension in Jupyter Notebook, and what I used to present to an audience for a grade. Downloading the file and launching it from your local machine is recommended.

The project that was submitted to the grading team is a Juputer Notebook file. It contains complete code, and a more detailed analysis. It can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c8gHAq13Pi5t0oZBt9tw0ad2C0eruVkk/view?usp=sharing
